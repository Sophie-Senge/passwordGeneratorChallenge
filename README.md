### The challenge

This week’s challenge required me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## My process
I spent days on this. Writing, rewriting, questioning my methods, and my logic. I saw many examples online with different ways to execute similar types of code and ended up sticking to my logic and making it work.

### Built with

- JavaScript


### What I learned
I think through this process I've come to get a better grasp of variables, functions, methods, arrays, objects and the process required to think through albeit, not complex to some people extremely complex to me, logical process to achieve the results I wanted.


### Continued development

Bring it on!
