## Overview

### The challenge

This week we were challenged to build a portfolio webpage with Bootstrap.

## My process
I found this project to be quite challenging. I had a very difficult time getting the bootstrap framework to adjust to the way that I had initially envisioned my page. My process was almost entirely trial and error. Delving into as much outside resources as I could, eventually I simplified what I had be striving to achieve and went for a design which was more simple. Once I made that choice building the rest of the page went more smoothly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Bootstrap is meant to make things easier and faster and I'm sure that it's an incredibly useful tool. However, I think I've only just now begun to grasp the smallest sense of how it works after many hours of struggle! 


### Continued development

I would hope to learn more about making Bootstrap look less contrived and more personal in a way which would make the process easier and less of a struggle. Design wise, I'm satisfied with the final outcome of this page but know that there will always be room for improvement and look forward to further learning to make my portfolio better.
